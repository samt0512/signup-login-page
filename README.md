# signup-login-page
My first project where I coded a program where users can sign up and log in with a username and password and their information is stored in a .txt file for later use.

Users are prompted with an input statement asking if they would like to log in or sign up. If they answer sign up they are prompted to create a username and password which is then stored in a .txt file. If they answer log in or after they sign up they are prompted to enter their username and password and the code checks to see if the username and password entered are in the .txt file. If they are the user is logged in. If the information entered is not in the .txt file they will be prompted to try again. If they do not input the correct login information within 5 attempts, "Login failed." is printed and they are sent back to the beginning of the code.

I decided to do this project because in my most recent Intro to CS unit, we learned about loops and combining loops with if statements and I was confused about both. 
This project helped to reinforce my skills in both loops and if statements as well as helped me to learn about using files outside of the code to store and to read data from. 

NOTE: I do not suggest using a .txt file to hold user information in an actual case where this would be used. I just used it for the sake of learning.
